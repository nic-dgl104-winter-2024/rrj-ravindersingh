### Week 8
## Activity 1: Research a new language
In the Research and Journal reflection, I chose Lua because it's a new language for me to explore. Writing about Lua will help me learn more about it while sharing my discoveries with others. Plus, Lua is used in many cool projects like games and websites, so studying it opens up exciting opportunities for me in the future. Overall, Lua seemed like the perfect choice for me to learn and grow as a programmer.
## What is the language used for ?
Lua is a programming language that's lightweight and easy to use. It's used in different areas:

* Games: Many video games use Lua for making things happen in the game, like characters moving or objects interacting.

* Small Devices: Lua is good for devices with limited resources, like smart home gadgets or tiny computers. It helps them do tasks without using up too much memory.

* Scripts: Some programs let you write little Lua programs to automate tasks, like organizing files or editing photos.

* Websites: While not as common, Lua is used in some websites to make them work better and handle lots of people using them at the same time.

* Learning: Lua is also used to teach people how to code because it's easy to understand and doesn't have too many complicated rules.

## Who uses the language?
Lua is a popular programming language used by many people in different areas. Game developers use Lua to make video games more fun by adding special features like how characters move and how smart they are. Popular games like World of Warcraft, Roblox, and Angry Birds leverage Lua to enhance gameplay experiences. It's also liked by people who make small gadgets, like smart home devices, because Lua helps these gadgets do things without using up too much memory. Some computer programs let you write Lua to make them do special tasks, like organizing files or editing pictures. While not as common, Lua is also used in some websites to make them work better, the frameworks like OpenResty and Lapis, enabling the development of scalable web applications and APIs.
