### Repo 2: queryBuilder
Link:- https://github.com/sqlkata/querybuilder
### Overview

SqlKata Query Builder is a powerful Sql Query Builder written in C#. It's secure and framework agnostic. Inspired by the top Query Builders available, like Laravel Query Builder and Knex.SqlKata has an expressive API. it follows a clean naming convention, which is very similar to the SQL syntax. By providing a level of abstraction over the supported database engines, that allows you to work with multiple databases with the same unified API. SqlKata supports complex queries, such as nested conditions, selection from SubQuery, filtering over SubQueries, Conditional Statements and others. Currently, it has built-in compilers for SqlServer, MySql, PostgreSQL, and Firebird.

## IDENTIFY ISSUES TO SUPPORT
### Issue 1: How to set to ignore Null objects? #121
Link: https://github.com/LitJSON/litjson/issues/121
### Summary 
This issue, raised by corbinyo, to find a way to handle null values during deserialization. The task involved ensuring that null values from JSON data were ignored when converting it into C# objects. He is using the Litjson library for the serialization and deserialization.

### Issue 2: How can i do "InsertOrReplace" in sqlite #641
Link: https://github.com/sqlkata/querybuilder/issues/641
### Summary 
This issue, raised by H0nok4 on Nov 17, 2022, The person is having trouble with doing an "insert or replace" action in SQLite. They're finding it tricky to insert new data or replace existing data in the table at the same time. They're looking for a straightforward way to solve this problem in SQLite.

### Issue 3: Type System.Object can't act as an array #159
Link: https://github.com/LitJSON/litjson/issues/159
### Summary
This issue, raised by eternityman Feb 28, 2024, the issue states that the type System.Object cannot act as an array. When using LitJson's ToObject<T> method to deserialize JSON into an object of type T, the library attempts to convert the JSON data into the specified type. However, in this case, the JSON data is incompatible with the expected type, resulting in the LitJson.JsonException. The exception occurs within the JsonMapper class of the LitJson library, specifically in the ReadValue method, which is responsible for reading and converting JSON values.

## Reflection
While searching for issues, I initially explored three different websites recommended by the instructor: Good First Issue, Up for Grabs, and CodeTriage. Afterward, I delved into various repositories and reviewed the listed issues. Some were too complex to grasp, while others lacked clear explanations. Eventually, I selected three issues that seemed feasible for me to tackle. However, one of the chosen issues, the third one, was inadequately described. I responded to the thread seeking further clarification. Unfortunately, I received a late reply from the person, and by then, it was too late for me to address the issue.

## CONTRIBUTE TO EXTERNAL COMMUNITY
After reviewing all the requirements, I installed all the necessary packages and tools as instructed. Next, I forked the repository and downloaded the project to my computer. To check if everything was set up correctly, I created a simple "hello world" program and ensured it compiled and ran smoothly.

Then, I explored various websites and thoroughly read the documentation for LitJson. I realized there wasn't a built-in function to ignore null values during deserialization. After some research, I discovered a manual method to ignore null values while deserializing the data.

## CONTRIBUTE TO PATTERN-LIBRARY
For part 2 of the community code project, I chose C# and decided to implement the singleton pattern. After learning about different ways to do this, I went with the lazy singleton method.

I started by creating a basic example using a student class with name, age, and grade attributes. Then, I made sure that only one instance of this class existed using the singleton pattern. This allowed me to easily manage and update student data throughout the program without any duplication.

## REFLECTION
I successfully completed the setup for the community code project by installing the required packages and tools, forking the repository, and downloading the project to my computer. I confirmed everything was working smoothly with a simple "hello world" program.

During my exploration of LitJson, I encountered a challenge when I realized there was no built-in function to ignore null values during deserialization. However, I found a manual method to address this issue through further research.

Moving on to part 2 of the project, I chose C# and decided to implement the singleton pattern using the lazy singleton method. By creating a basic example with a student class and ensuring only one instance existed, I was able to effectively manage student data without duplication throughout the program.
