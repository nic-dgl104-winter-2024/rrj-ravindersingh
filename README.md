# Research and Reflection Journal
### Week 8
## Activity 1: Research a new language
In the Research and Journal reflection, I chose Lua because it's a new language for me to explore. Writing about Lua will help me learn more about it while sharing my discoveries with others. Plus, Lua is used in many cool projects like games and websites, so studying it opens up exciting opportunities for me in the future. Overall, Lua seemed like the perfect choice for me to learn and grow as a programmer.
## What is the language used for ?
Lua is a programming language that's lightweight and easy to use. It's used in different areas:

* Games: Many video games use Lua for making things happen in the game, like characters moving or objects interacting.

* Small Devices: Lua is good for devices with limited resources, like smart home gadgets or tiny computers. It helps them do tasks without using up too much memory.

* Scripts: Some programs let you write little Lua programs to automate tasks, like organizing files or editing photos.

* Websites: While not as common, Lua is used in some websites to make them work better and handle lots of people using them at the same time.

* Learning: Lua is also used to teach people how to code because it's easy to understand and doesn't have too many complicated rules.

## Who uses the language?
Lua is a popular programming language used by many people in different areas. Game developers use Lua to make video games more fun by adding special features like how characters move and how smart they are. Popular games like World of Warcraft, Roblox, and Angry Birds leverage Lua to enhance gameplay experiences. It's also liked by people who make small gadgets, like smart home devices, because Lua helps these gadgets do things without using up too much memory. Some computer programs let you write Lua to make them do special tasks, like organizing files or editing pictures. While not as common, Lua is also used in some websites to make them work better, the frameworks like OpenResty and Lapis, enabling the development of scalable web applications and APIs.

## What are some useful resources ?
The resources which is mentioned below, offer a variety of learning options for anyone interested in mastering Lua. Whether you're a beginner or looking to deepen your understanding, these resources can help you learn Lua at your own pace and level of expertise.

* Lua Website: [lua.org](https://www.lua.org/) - Offers official documentation, tutorials, and guides.

## Why are these specific resources useful?
These are great resource if someone is really intersted to learn Lua.

The Lua website (lua.org) is a fantastic place to begin. It provides official documentation, tutorials, and guides to help you understand the language and its features.

Wikipedia's page on Lua also offers a wealth of information about the language, including its history, features, and common uses. It's a great resource for gaining a deeper understanding of Lua's background and capabilities.

For those who prefer structured learning, the chapter on Lua in the Springer link provided offers in-depth insights into Lua programming concepts. It may be especially helpful for those looking for more technical information or exploring Lua for academic purposes.

If you're just starting out and want a beginner-friendly guide, the Turing blog post on Lua programming is an excellent resource. It provides a comprehensive introduction to Lua, covering everything from basic syntax to advanced topics, in an easy-to-understand format.
## Reflection
Researching Lua has taught me a lot about how it's used in different areas. It's not just for making games but also for controlling smart devices and even websites. People who make games, software, and gadgets all use Lua. I found some helpful resources like the Lua website and Wikipedia, which explain everything in simple terms. These resources have made it easier for me to understand Lua and how it works. Overall, learning about Lua has been interesting, and I'm excited to use it in my projects.

## Write a user story
I've created four different stories for people who use the Instagram app.
### User Stories
1. As a user, I can upload photos or videos from my device to share them with my followers.
2. As a user, I can go live on Instagram to share real-time moments and experiences with my followers.
3. As a user, I can create reels on Instagram to share videos with my followers, utilizing features like music, effects, and editing tools to produce engaging and entertaining content.
4. As a user, I can make audio or video calls and send messages to my contacts on Instagram.

## Choose a language for Community Code
I've chosen C# for the community code project because I'm already learning it in our DGL - 111 course. Since I'm familiar with C# and interested in it, I want to gain more experience and knowledge by working on this project.
## Star github topic and repositories of interest

* https://github.com/verybadcat/CSharpMath :- A GitHub repository for C# math library, offering tools for mathematical expression parsing, rendering, and formatting.

* https://github.com/bitzhuwei/CSharpGL :- This GitHub project provides C# wrappers for OpenGL, enabling developers to create high-performance graphics applications and games.

* https://github.com/KevinDockx/CSharp10DesignPatterns :- A GitHub repository featuring examples and explanations of various design patterns implemented in C# 10, aiding developers in understanding and implementing best practices in software design.

* https://github.com/doghappy/socket.io-client-csharp :- A GitHub repository offering a C# client library for Socket.IO, allowing developers to communicate between server and client applications using WebSockets.
### Week 9
## FIND POTENTIAL PROJECTS TO CONTRIBUTE TO
### Community Code Project Repo
For the community code project (part 1), I've picked two repositories: LitJson and SQLite. From LitJson, I've selected two issues to address, and from SQLite, I've chosen one issue to focus on solving.
### Repo 1: LitJson
Link:- https://github.com/LitJSON/litjson

### Overview
   
The LitJSON community code project is an open-source initiative aimed at developing and maintaining a lightweight and efficient JSON library for the .NET platform. Built upon the principles of simplicity,   performance, and ease of use, LitJSON provides developers with a robust toolset for working with JSON data in their .NET applications.
  
Key Feaures
Simplifies JSON data handling: LitJSON simplifies the process of parsing and serializing JSON data, allowing developers to focus on building robust applications.
Improves performance: With its lightweight design and optimized performance, LitJSON ensures fast and efficient JSON processing, even with large datasets.
Enhances productivity: By providing a user-friendly API and comprehensive documentation, LitJSON helps developers save time and effort during the development process.

### Repo 2: queryBuilder
Link:- https://github.com/sqlkata/querybuilder
### Overview

SqlKata Query Builder is a powerful Sql Query Builder written in C#. It's secure and framework agnostic. Inspired by the top Query Builders available, like Laravel Query Builder and Knex.SqlKata has an expressive API. it follows a clean naming convention, which is very similar to the SQL syntax. By providing a level of abstraction over the supported database engines, that allows you to work with multiple databases with the same unified API. SqlKata supports complex queries, such as nested conditions, selection from SubQuery, filtering over SubQueries, Conditional Statements and others. Currently, it has built-in compilers for SqlServer, MySql, PostgreSQL, and Firebird.
