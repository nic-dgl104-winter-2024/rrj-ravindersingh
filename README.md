# Research and Reflection Journal
### Week 8
## Activity 1: Research a new language
In the Research and Journal reflection, I chose Lua because it's a new language for me to explore. Writing about Lua will help me learn more about it while sharing my discoveries with others. Plus, Lua is used in many cool projects like games and websites, so studying it opens up exciting opportunities for me in the future. Overall, Lua seemed like the perfect choice for me to learn and grow as a programmer.
